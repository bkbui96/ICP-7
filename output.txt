<p>In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 <a href="/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">TB</a> of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup>

<p>In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 <a href="/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">TB</a> of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 <a href="/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">TB</a> of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 <a href="/wiki/Terabyte" title="Terabyte">TB</a> of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-91"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-92"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-167"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-168"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-169"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup>

Google LLC[5]is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which includeonline advertising technologies,search engine,cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of theBig Fourtechnology companies, alongsideAmazon,AppleandFacebook.[6][7]
Google was founded in 1998 byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhile they were Ph.D. students atStanford UniversityinCalifornia. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power throughsupervotingstock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed theGoogleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate calledAlphabet Inc.Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.Sundar Pichaiwas appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.
The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs,Google Sheets, andGoogle Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo,Duo,Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps,Waze,Google Earth,Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of theAndroidmobile operating system, theGoogle Chromeweb browser, andChrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of itsNexusdevices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including theGoogle Pixelsmartphone,Google Homesmart speaker,Google Wifimesh wireless router, andGoogle Daydreamvirtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber,Project Fi, andGoogle Station).[8]
Google.com is the most visited website in the world.[9]Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, includingYouTubeandBlogger. Google is the most valuable brand in the world as of  2017,[update][10]but has received significantcriticisminvolving issues such asprivacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust,censorship, and search neutrality. Google'smission statementis "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil" until the phrase was removed from the company's code of conduct around May 2018.[11][12]
Google began in January 1996 as a research project byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhen they were both PhD students atStanford UniversityinStanford, California.[14]
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[15]They called this new technologyPageRank; it determined a website'srelevanceby the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[16][17]
Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[18][19][20]Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word "googol",[21][22]the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[23]Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domainsgoogle.stanford.edu[24]andz.stanford.edu.[25]
The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[26]and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[14]) inMenlo Park, California.Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[14][27][28]
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 fromAndy Bechtolsheim, co-founder ofSun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[30]Google received money from three otherangel investorsin 1998:Amazon.comfounderJeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professorDavid Cheriton, and entrepreneurRam Shriram.[31]
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[31]a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[32]with major investors including theventure capitalfirmsKleiner PerkinsandSequoia Capital.[30]
Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google toExcite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it.[33]
Google'sinitial public offering(IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, andEric Schmidtagreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[34]
At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[35][36]Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built byMorgan StanleyandCredit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[37][38]The sale of $1.67 bn (billion) gave Google amarket capitalizationof more than $23bn.[39]By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn.[40]The vast majority of the 271 million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires.Yahoo!, a competitor of Google, also benefitted because it owned 8.4 million shares of Google before the IPO took place.[41]
There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires.[42]As a reply to this concern, co-founders Brin and Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture.[43]In 2005, articles inThe New York Times[44]and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[45][46][47]In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment.[48]Google has also faced allegations ofsexismandageismfrom former employees.[49][50]In 2013, aclass action againstseveralSilicon Valleycompanies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[51]
The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[52]primarily because of strong sales and earnings in theonline advertisingmarket.[53]The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors andmutual funds.[53]GOOG shares split into GOOGclass C sharesand GOOGLclass A shares.[54]The company is listed on theNASDAQstock exchange under theticker symbolsGOOGL and GOOG, and on theFrankfurt Stock Exchangeunder the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][55]
In March 1999, the company moved its offices toPalo Alto, California,[56]which is home to several prominentSilicon Valleytechnology start-ups.[57]The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[58][14]To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[59]
This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered byGoto.com, anIdealabspin-off created byBill Gross.[60][61]When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamedYahoo! Search Marketing. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.[62]
In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider forYahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacingInktomi.[63][64]
In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism.[65]The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex fromSilicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway inMountain View, California.[66]The complex became known as theGoogleplex, a play on the wordgoogolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. TheGoogleplexinteriors were designed byClive WilkinsonArchitects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[67]By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be added to theMerriam-WebsterCollegiate Dictionaryand theOxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".[68][69]The first use of "Google" as a verb inpop culturehappened on the TV seriesBuffy the Vampire Slayer, in 2002.[70]
In 2005,The Washington Postreported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[71]In January 2008, all the data that passed through Google's MapReduce software component had an aggregated size of 20petabytesper day.[72][73][74]In 2009, aCNNreport about top political searches of 2009 noted that "more than a billion searches" are being typed into Google on a daily basis.[75]In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million).[76]
The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[77]
In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[78]
Google announced the launch of a new company, calledCalico, on September 19, 2013, to be led byApple, Inc.chairmanArthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".[79]
Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, and in 2016 it celebrated its 18th birthday with an animated version of its logo (a "Google Doodle"),[80]although it has used other dates for its official birthday.[81]The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engineYahoo! Searchin 2005 has been suggested as the cause.[82][83]
TheAlliance for Affordable Internet(A4AI) was launched in October 2013; Google is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includesFacebook,Intel, andMicrosoft. Led bySir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[84]
The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[85]Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[86]
According toInterbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behindApple Inc.) in 2013,[87]2014,[88]2015,[89]and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[90]
In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85TBof data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."[91][92]
As of  October 2016,[update]Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries.[93]Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.[9]Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube[94]and Blogger.[95]
In 2001, Google acquiredDeja News, the operators of a large archive of materials fromUsenet.[96][97]Google rebranded the archive asGoogle Groups, and by the end of the year, it had expanded the history back to 1981.[98][99]
In April 2003, Google acquiredApplied Semantics, a company specializing in making software applications for the online advertising space.[100][101]TheAdSensecontextual advertising technology developed by Applied Semantics was adopted into Google's advertising efforts.[102][99]
In 2004, Google acquiredKeyhole, Inc.[103]Keyhole'seponymousproduct was later renamedGoogle Earth.
In April 2005, Google acquiredUrchin Software, using their Urchin on Demand product (along with ideas from Adaptive Path's Measure Map) to createGoogle Analyticsin 2006.
In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[104][105]and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[106][107]
On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquireDoubleClickfor $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[108]The deal was approved despite anti-trust concerns raised by competitorsMicrosoftandAT&T.[109]
In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the firm has partnered with other organizations for research, advertising, and other activities. In 2005, Google partnered withNASAAmes Research Centerto build 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of offices.[110]
In 2005 Google partnered withAOL[111]to enhance each other'svideo searchservices. In 2006 Google andFox Interactive MediaofNews Corporationentered into a $900 million agreement to provide search and advertising on the then-popular social networking siteMySpace.[112]
In 2007, Google began sponsoringNORAD Tracks Santa, displacing the former sponsor AOL. NORAD Tracks Santa purports to followSanta Claus' progress onChristmas Eve,[113]using Google Earth to "track Santa" in 3-D for the first time.[114][115]
In 2008, Google developed a partnership withGeoEyeto launch a satellite providing Google with high-resolution (0.41 m monochrome, 1.65 m color) imagery for Google Earth. The satellite was launched fromVandenberg Air Force Baseon September 6, 2008.[116]Google also announced in 2008 that it was hosting an archive ofLife Magazine's photographs.[117][118]
In 2010,Google Energymade its first investment in arenewable energyproject, putting $38.8 million into twowind farmsinNorth Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed byNextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.[119]In February 2010, theFederal Energy Regulatory CommissionFERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[120]The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities.[121]The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[122]
Also in 2010, Google purchasedGlobal IP Solutions, a Norway-based company that provides web-basedteleconferencingand other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products.[123]On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad networkAdMob. This occurred days after theFederal Trade Commissionclosed its investigation into the purchase.[124]Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount.[125]In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.[126]
On April 4, 2011,The Globe and Mailreported that Google bid $900 million for 6000Nortel Networkspatents.[127]
On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquireMotorola Mobilityfor $12.5 billion[128][129]subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.[130]The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval ofChina.[131]
This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[132]mainlyAppleandMicrosoft,[130]and to allow it to continue to freely offerAndroid.[133]After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google's strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to lay off 4000 Motorola Mobility employees.[134]On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility toFlextronicsfor $75 million.[135]As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices.[136]On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility toArris Groupfor $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. As a part of this deal, Google acquired a 15.7% stake in Arris Group valued at $300 million.[137][138]
In June 2013, Google acquiredWaze, a $966 million deal.[139]While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze andGoogle Maps, Google's own mapping service.[140]
On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquireDeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company fromLondon. DeepMind describes itself as having the ability to combine the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build general-purpose learning algorithms. DeepMind's first commercial applications were used in simulations, e-commerce and games. As of  December 2013,[update]it was reported that DeepMind had roughly 75 employees.[141]Technology news websiteRecodereported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price.[142][143]The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[144]
On January 29, 2014, Google announced that it would divest Motorola Mobility toLenovofor $2.91 billion, a fraction of the original $12.5 billion price paid by Google to acquire the company. Google retained all but 2000 of Motorola's patents and entered into cross-licensing deals.[145]
On September 21, 2017,HTCannounced a "cooperation agreement" in which it would sell non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, as well as smartphone talent, to Google for $1.1 billion.[146][147][148]
On December 6, 2017, Google made its first investment inIndiaand picked up a significant minority stake in hyper-local concierge and delivery player Dunzo.[149]The Benguluru-based startup received $12 million investment in Google's series B funding round.[150]
On March 29, 2018, Google led a Series C funding round into online-to-offline fashion e-commerce start-up Fynd.[151]It was its second direct investment in India with an undisclosed amount.[152][153]In this way, Google is also looking to build an ecosystem in India across high-frequency hyper-local transactions as well as in the healthcare, financial services, and education sectors.
On August 23, 2018, Google deleted 39YouTubeaccounts, 13Google+accounts and 6 blogs onBloggerdue to their engagement in politically motivated phishing, the deleted accounts were found to be tied withIslamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).[154][155][156]
Google data centersare located in North and South America, Asia, Europe.[157]
Traditionally, Google relied onparallel computingon commodity hardware[158]like mainstream x86 computers similar to home PCs[159]to keep costs per query low.[160]In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[160]
In October 2013,The Washington Postreported that the U.S.National Security Agencyintercepted communications between Google's data centers, as part of a program namedMUSCULAR.[161][162]This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network.[163]Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013.[164]
Google's most efficient data center runs at 35 °C (95 °F) using only fresh air cooling, requiring no electrically powered air conditioning; the servers run so hot that humans cannot go near them for extended periods.[165]
An August 2011 report estimated that Google had about 900,000 servers in their data centers, based on energy usage. The report does state that "Google never says how many servers are running in its data centers."[166]
In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".[167][168][169]
On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as aconglomeratecalledAlphabet. Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure,Sundar Pichaibecame CEO of Google, replacingLarry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[170][171][172]
On September 1, 2017, Google Inc. announced its plans of restructuring as alimited liability company, Google LLC, as a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings Inc., which is formed as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. to hold the equity of its other subsidiaries, including Google LLC and other bets.[173]
As per its 2017 Annual report, Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on google and YouTube, android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. 46% of this was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namelyAdMob,AdSense(such as AdSense for Content,AdSensefor Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[174]
For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492billion in total advertising revenues and only $112million in licensing and other revenues.[175]In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[176]In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the companyDoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[177][178]
In 2007, Google launched "AdSense for Mobile", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[179]
Google Analyticsallows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[180]Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google'sAdWordsallows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[181]The sister service, GoogleAdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[182]
One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility ofclick fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20  percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[183]
In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements ofOceana, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."[184]In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because ofantitrustconcerns by theU.S. Department of Justice. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.[185][186]
In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.[187]
According tocomScoremarket research from November 2009,Google Searchis the dominant search engine in the United States market, with amarket shareof 65.6%.[188]Googleindexesbillions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords andoperators.[189]
In 2003,The New York Timescomplained about Google'sindexing, claiming that Google'scachingof content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.[190]In bothField v. GoogleandParker v. Google, the United States District Court ofNevadaruled in favor of Google.[191][192]The publication2600: The Hacker Quarterlyhas compiled a list of words that google's newinstant search featurewill not search.[193]
Google also hostsGoogle Books. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. TheAuthors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.[194]Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.[195]Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière (Éditions du Seuil) from its database.[196]In competition withAmazon.com, Google sells digital versions of new books.[197]
On July 21, 2010, in response toBing, Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence ofthumbnailsthat enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.[198]
The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.[199]
In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusiveinterstitial advertisementswhen a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.[200]
In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages fromGmailand photos fromGoogle Photos.[201][202]

Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.[204]Site Search customers were notified by email in late March 2017 that no new licenses for Site Search would be sold after April 1, 2017, but that customer and technical support would be provided for the duration of existing license agreements.[205][206]
On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, "a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers" which can be integrated withBigQueryon the Google Cloud Platform.

In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands ofsolar panelsto provide up to 1.6 megawattsof electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[326]The system will be the largestsolar power systemconstructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[326]In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds ofgoatsto keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing thecarbon footprintof mowing the extensive grounds.[327][328]The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated fromBob Widlar, an engineer who worked forNational Semiconductor.[329]In 2008, Google faced accusations inHarper's Magazineof being an "energy glutton". The company was accused of employing its "Don't be evil" motto and its publicenergy-savingcampaigns to cover up or make up for the massive amounts of energy its servers require.[330]
Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[331]It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namelySydney(birthplace location ofGoogle Maps)[332]andLondon(part ofAndroiddevelopment).[333]
In November 2013, Google announced plans for a newLondonheadquarter, a notable 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[334]Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to theCamden Councilin June 2017. The new building, if approved, will feature a rooftop garden with a running track, giant moving blinds, a swimming pool, and a multi-use games area for sports.[335][336]
In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus inHyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[337][338]
Since  1998,[update]Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on theirhomepageintended to celebrateholidays, events, achievements and people. The first GoogleDoodlewas in honor of theBurning Man Festivalof 1998.[339][340]The doodle was designed byLarry PageandSergey Brinto notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-internDennis Hwangto design a logo forBastille Dayin 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".[341]
Google has a tradition of creatingApril Fools' Dayjokes. On April 1, 2000,Google MentalPlexallegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[342]In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service calledTiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of afiber-opticcable down their toilet.[343]Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement forGmail Paper, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.[344]In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.[345]
In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor ofTopeka, Kansas, whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its newGoogle Fiber Project.[346][347]In 2011, Google announcedGmail Motion, an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.[348]
Google's services containeaster eggs, such as theSwedish Chef's "Bork bork bork,"Pig Latin, "Hacker" orleetspeak,Elmer Fudd,Pirate, andKlingonas language selections for its search engine.[349]The search engine calculator provides theAnswer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and EverythingfromDouglas Adams'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[350]When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.[351]
When searching for the word "anagram," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"[352]In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "kayakacross thePacific Ocean." DuringFIFA World Cup 2010, search queries including "World Cup" and "FIFA" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.[353]
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropicGoogle.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[354]The mission of the organization is to create awareness aboutclimate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viableplug-in hybridelectric vehiclethat can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hiredLarry Brilliantas the program's executive director in 2004[355]and Megan Smith has since[update]replaced him has director.[356]
In 2008, Google announced its "project 10100" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[357]After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[358]Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[359]
In March 2007, in partnership with theMathematical Sciences Research Institute(MSRI), Google hosted the firstJulia Robinson Mathematics Festivalat its headquarters in Mountain View.[360]In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros toInternational Mathematical Olympiadto support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[361][362]In July 2012, Google launched a "Legalize Love" campaign in support ofgay rights.[363]
Google uses varioustax avoidance strategies. Out of thefive largest American technology companies, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits throughIrelandand theNetherlandsand then toBermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.[364]This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google'stransfer pricingpractices.[365]
Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.[366]
Google Vice-PresidentMatt Brittintestified to thePublic Accounts Committeeof the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[367]In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[368]
In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[369]
Since  2007,[update]Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[370]
Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[371]
In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE<C)" project.[372]However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".[373]
In June 2013,The Washington Postreported that Google had donated $50,000 to theCompetitive Enterprise Institute, alibertarianthink tankthat calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.[374]
In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma SenatorJim Inhofe, who has called climate change a "hoax".[375]In 2014 Google cut ties with theAmerican Legislative Exchange Council(ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.[376]
In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[377]
In 2013, Google ranked 5th inlobbyingspending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[378]
Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including theHigh-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigationwhich resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.[379]
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of€2.42 billion from theEuropean Unionfor "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."[380]Commenting on the penalty,New Scientistmagazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.[381]
On July 18, 2018,[382]theEuropean Commissionfined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[383]that it had appealed the fine to theGeneral Courtof the European Union.[384]
On January 21, 2019, French data regulatorCNILimposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was “deeply committed” to transparency and was “studying the decision” before determining its response.[385]
Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, includingcriticism of the companyover issues such asaggressive tax avoidance,[386]search neutrality,copyright,censorshipof search results and content,[387]andprivacy.[388][389]Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others'intellectual property, concerns that itscompilation of datamay violate people'sprivacy, and theenergy consumptionof its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such asmonopoly,restraint of trade,anti-competitive practices, andpatent infringement.
FormerDeputy Defense SecretaryRobert O. Workin 2018 criticizes Google and its employees have stepped into aMoral Hazardfor themselves as not continuing Pentagon'sartificial intelligenceproject while helping the autocratic communist China's AI technology that could be used against the United States in a conflict. He described Google as hypocritical, given it has opened an AI center in China and “Anything that’s going on in the AI center in China is going to the Chinese government and then will ultimately end up in the hands of the Chinese military." Work said. “I didn’t see any Google employee saying, ‘Hmm, maybe we shouldn’t do that.'” Google's dealings with China is decrying as unpatriotic.[390][391][392][393]
Google adhered to theInternet censorship policies of China,[394]enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "TheGreat Firewall of China".The Interceptreported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the people's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known asDragonfly) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".[395][396]
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffGeneralJoseph Dunfordalso criticizes Google as "it’s inexplicable" that it continue investing in autocraticcommunist China, who usescensorship technology to restrain freedomsandcrackdown peoplethere and has long history ofintellectual propertyandpatenttheft which hurts U.S. companies, while simultaneously not renewing further research and development collaborations withthe Pentagon. He said “I’m not sure that people at Google will enjoy a world order that is informed by the norms and standards of Russia or China.” He urges Google work directly with the U.S. government instead of making controversial inroads into China. SenatorMark Warner(D-VA) criticized Dragonfly evidences China's success at "recruit[ing] Western companies to their information control efforts" while China exports cyber and censorship infrastructure toauthoritarianregimes like Venezuela, Ethiopia, and Pakistan.[397][398][399]
Google'smission statement, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",[400]and its unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil".[401]In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".[402]The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.[11]
Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviors which appear to contradict this.[403][404]
Following media reports aboutPRISM, NSA's massive electronicsurveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[405]According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.[406]
On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributeda memothroughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[407]Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace", and he was fired on the same day.[408][409][410]New York TimescolumnistDavid Brooksargued Pichai had mishandled the case, and called for his resignation.[411][412]
Reportedly, Google's influencedNew Americathink tank to expel their Open Markets research group, after the group has criticized Google monopolistic power and supported theEU $2.7B fine of Google.[413][414]
Google has worked with theUnited States Department of Defenseon drone software through the 2017 "Project Maven" that could be used to improve the accuracy ofdrone strikes.[415]Thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEOSundar Pichaito end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.[416]In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not renew their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.[417]
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before theNinth Circuit of the United States Court of Appealsthat "google" had sufferedgenericide. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with theNational Arbitration Forum(NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."[418]
On 10 December 2018, a New Zealand court ordered that the name of a man accused of murdering British travellerGrace Millanebe withheld from the public. The next morning, Google named the man in an email it sent people who had subscribed to "what's trending in New Zealand".[419]Lawyers warned that this could compromise the trial, and Justice Minister Andrew Little said that Google was in contempt of court.[420][421]Google said that it had been unaware of the court order, and that the email had been created by algorithms.
On 21 January 2019, Google was fined €50 million (US$57 million) for violating theGDPR.[422]It is the biggest fine issued byCNILfor violation of the regulation.[423]

Google LLC[5]is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which includeonline advertising technologies,search engine,cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of theBig Fourtechnology companies, alongsideAmazon,AppleandFacebook.[6][7]
Google was founded in 1998 byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhile they were Ph.D. students atStanford UniversityinCalifornia. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power throughsupervotingstock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed theGoogleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate calledAlphabet Inc.Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.Sundar Pichaiwas appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.
The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs,Google Sheets, andGoogle Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo,Duo,Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps,Waze,Google Earth,Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of theAndroidmobile operating system, theGoogle Chromeweb browser, andChrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of itsNexusdevices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including theGoogle Pixelsmartphone,Google Homesmart speaker,Google Wifimesh wireless router, andGoogle Daydreamvirtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber,Project Fi, andGoogle Station).[8]
Google.com is the most visited website in the world.[9]Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, includingYouTubeandBlogger. Google is the most valuable brand in the world as of  2017,[update][10]but has received significantcriticisminvolving issues such asprivacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust,censorship, and search neutrality. Google'smission statementis "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil" until the phrase was removed from the company's code of conduct around May 2018.[11][12]
Google began in January 1996 as a research project byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhen they were both PhD students atStanford UniversityinStanford, California.[14]
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[15]They called this new technologyPageRank; it determined a website'srelevanceby the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[16][17]
Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[18][19][20]Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word "googol",[21][22]the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[23]Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domainsgoogle.stanford.edu[24]andz.stanford.edu.[25]
The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[26]and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[14]) inMenlo Park, California.Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[14][27][28]
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 fromAndy Bechtolsheim, co-founder ofSun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[30]Google received money from three otherangel investorsin 1998:Amazon.comfounderJeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professorDavid Cheriton, and entrepreneurRam Shriram.[31]
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[31]a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[32]with major investors including theventure capitalfirmsKleiner PerkinsandSequoia Capital.[30]
Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google toExcite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it.[33]
Google'sinitial public offering(IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, andEric Schmidtagreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[34]
At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[35][36]Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built byMorgan StanleyandCredit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[37][38]The sale of $1.67 bn (billion) gave Google amarket capitalizationof more than $23bn.[39]By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn.[40]The vast majority of the 271 million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires.Yahoo!, a competitor of Google, also benefitted because it owned 8.4 million shares of Google before the IPO took place.[41]
There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires.[42]As a reply to this concern, co-founders Brin and Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture.[43]In 2005, articles inThe New York Times[44]and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[45][46][47]In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment.[48]Google has also faced allegations ofsexismandageismfrom former employees.[49][50]In 2013, aclass action againstseveralSilicon Valleycompanies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[51]
The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[52]primarily because of strong sales and earnings in theonline advertisingmarket.[53]The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors andmutual funds.[53]GOOG shares split into GOOGclass C sharesand GOOGLclass A shares.[54]The company is listed on theNASDAQstock exchange under theticker symbolsGOOGL and GOOG, and on theFrankfurt Stock Exchangeunder the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][55]
In March 1999, the company moved its offices toPalo Alto, California,[56]which is home to several prominentSilicon Valleytechnology start-ups.[57]The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[58][14]To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[59]
This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered byGoto.com, anIdealabspin-off created byBill Gross.[60][61]When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamedYahoo! Search Marketing. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.[62]
In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider forYahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacingInktomi.[63][64]
In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism.[65]The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex fromSilicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway inMountain View, California.[66]The complex became known as theGoogleplex, a play on the wordgoogolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. TheGoogleplexinteriors were designed byClive WilkinsonArchitects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[67]By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be added to theMerriam-WebsterCollegiate Dictionaryand theOxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".[68][69]The first use of "Google" as a verb inpop culturehappened on the TV seriesBuffy the Vampire Slayer, in 2002.[70]
In 2005,The Washington Postreported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[71]In January 2008, all the data that passed through Google's MapReduce software component had an aggregated size of 20petabytesper day.[72][73][74]In 2009, aCNNreport about top political searches of 2009 noted that "more than a billion searches" are being typed into Google on a daily basis.[75]In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million).[76]
The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[77]
In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[78]
Google announced the launch of a new company, calledCalico, on September 19, 2013, to be led byApple, Inc.chairmanArthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".[79]
Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, and in 2016 it celebrated its 18th birthday with an animated version of its logo (a "Google Doodle"),[80]although it has used other dates for its official birthday.[81]The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engineYahoo! Searchin 2005 has been suggested as the cause.[82][83]
TheAlliance for Affordable Internet(A4AI) was launched in October 2013; Google is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includesFacebook,Intel, andMicrosoft. Led bySir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[84]
The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[85]Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[86]
According toInterbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behindApple Inc.) in 2013,[87]2014,[88]2015,[89]and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[90]
In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85TBof data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."[91][92]

In 2010,Google Energymade its first investment in arenewable energyproject, putting $38.8 million into twowind farmsinNorth Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed byNextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.[119]In February 2010, theFederal Energy Regulatory CommissionFERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[120]The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities.[121]The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[122]
Also in 2010, Google purchasedGlobal IP Solutions, a Norway-based company that provides web-basedteleconferencingand other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products.[123]On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad networkAdMob. This occurred days after theFederal Trade Commissionclosed its investigation into the purchase.[124]Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount.[125]In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.[126]
On April 4, 2011,The Globe and Mailreported that Google bid $900 million for 6000Nortel Networkspatents.[127]
On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquireMotorola Mobilityfor $12.5 billion[128][129]subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.[130]The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval ofChina.[131]
This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[132]mainlyAppleandMicrosoft,[130]and to allow it to continue to freely offerAndroid.[133]After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google's strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to lay off 4000 Motorola Mobility employees.[134]On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility toFlextronicsfor $75 million.[135]As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices.[136]On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility toArris Groupfor $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. As a part of this deal, Google acquired a 15.7% stake in Arris Group valued at $300 million.[137][138]
In June 2013, Google acquiredWaze, a $966 million deal.[139]While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze andGoogle Maps, Google's own mapping service.[140]
On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquireDeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company fromLondon. DeepMind describes itself as having the ability to combine the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build general-purpose learning algorithms. DeepMind's first commercial applications were used in simulations, e-commerce and games. As of  December 2013,[update]it was reported that DeepMind had roughly 75 employees.[141]Technology news websiteRecodereported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price.[142][143]The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[144]
On January 29, 2014, Google announced that it would divest Motorola Mobility toLenovofor $2.91 billion, a fraction of the original $12.5 billion price paid by Google to acquire the company. Google retained all but 2000 of Motorola's patents and entered into cross-licensing deals.[145]

On March 29, 2018, Google led a Series C funding round into online-to-offline fashion e-commerce start-up Fynd.[151]It was its second direct investment in India with an undisclosed amount.[152][153]In this way, Google is also looking to build an ecosystem in India across high-frequency hyper-local transactions as well as in the healthcare, financial services, and education sectors.
On August 23, 2018, Google deleted 39YouTubeaccounts, 13Google+accounts and 6 blogs onBloggerdue to their engagement in politically motivated phishing, the deleted accounts were found to be tied withIslamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).[154][155][156]
Google data centersare located in North and South America, Asia, Europe.[157]
Traditionally, Google relied onparallel computingon commodity hardware[158]like mainstream x86 computers similar to home PCs[159]to keep costs per query low.[160]In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[160]
In October 2013,The Washington Postreported that the U.S.National Security Agencyintercepted communications between Google's data centers, as part of a program namedMUSCULAR.[161][162]This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network.[163]Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013.[164]
Google's most efficient data center runs at 35 °C (95 °F) using only fresh air cooling, requiring no electrically powered air conditioning; the servers run so hot that humans cannot go near them for extended periods.[165]
An August 2011 report estimated that Google had about 900,000 servers in their data centers, based on energy usage. The report does state that "Google never says how many servers are running in its data centers."[166]
In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".[167][168][169]
On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as aconglomeratecalledAlphabet. Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure,Sundar Pichaibecame CEO of Google, replacingLarry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[170][171][172]
On September 1, 2017, Google Inc. announced its plans of restructuring as alimited liability company, Google LLC, as a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings Inc., which is formed as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. to hold the equity of its other subsidiaries, including Google LLC and other bets.[173]
As per its 2017 Annual report, Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on google and YouTube, android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. 46% of this was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namelyAdMob,AdSense(such as AdSense for Content,AdSensefor Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[174]
For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492billion in total advertising revenues and only $112million in licensing and other revenues.[175]In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[176]In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the companyDoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[177][178]
In 2007, Google launched "AdSense for Mobile", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[179]
Google Analyticsallows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[180]Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google'sAdWordsallows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[181]The sister service, GoogleAdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[182]
One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility ofclick fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20  percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[183]
In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements ofOceana, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."[184]In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because ofantitrustconcerns by theU.S. Department of Justice. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.[185][186]
In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.[187]
According tocomScoremarket research from November 2009,Google Searchis the dominant search engine in the United States market, with amarket shareof 65.6%.[188]Googleindexesbillions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords andoperators.[189]
In 2003,The New York Timescomplained about Google'sindexing, claiming that Google'scachingof content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.[190]In bothField v. GoogleandParker v. Google, the United States District Court ofNevadaruled in favor of Google.[191][192]The publication2600: The Hacker Quarterlyhas compiled a list of words that google's newinstant search featurewill not search.[193]
Google also hostsGoogle Books. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. TheAuthors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.[194]Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.[195]Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière (Éditions du Seuil) from its database.[196]In competition withAmazon.com, Google sells digital versions of new books.[197]
On July 21, 2010, in response toBing, Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence ofthumbnailsthat enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.[198]
The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.[199]
In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusiveinterstitial advertisementswhen a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.[200]
In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages fromGmailand photos fromGoogle Photos.[201][202]

Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.[204]Site Search customers were notified by email in late March 2017 that no new licenses for Site Search would be sold after April 1, 2017, but that customer and technical support would be provided for the duration of existing license agreements.[205][206]

The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team, which has been instrumental in securing large partnerships.[310]The New York headquarters includes a game room, micro-kitchens, and a video game area.[311]In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion, the biggest for a single building in the United States that year.[312][313]In February 2012, Google moved additional employees to the New York City campus, with a total of around 2,750 employees.[314]
Google's New York City location continued to expand in 2018. In March of that year, Google's parent company Alphabet boughtChelsea Marketbuilding for $2.4 billion nearby its current New York HQ. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[315][316][317][318]The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan'sHudson Squareneighborhood.[319][320]Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[321]
By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division inAnn Arbor, Michigan.[322]In November 2006, Google opened offices onCarnegie Mellon's campus inPittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding andsmartphone applicationsand programs.[323][324]Other office locations in the U.S. includeAtlanta, Georgia;Austin, Texas;Boulder, Colorado;Cambridge, Massachusetts;San Francisco,California;Seattle, Washington;Kirkland, Washington;Birmingham, Michigan;Reston, Virginia, andWashington, D.C.[325]
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands ofsolar panelsto provide up to 1.6 megawattsof electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[326]The system will be the largestsolar power systemconstructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[326]In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds ofgoatsto keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing thecarbon footprintof mowing the extensive grounds.[327][328]The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated fromBob Widlar, an engineer who worked forNational Semiconductor.[329]In 2008, Google faced accusations inHarper's Magazineof being an "energy glutton". The company was accused of employing its "Don't be evil" motto and its publicenergy-savingcampaigns to cover up or make up for the massive amounts of energy its servers require.[330]
Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[331]It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namelySydney(birthplace location ofGoogle Maps)[332]andLondon(part ofAndroiddevelopment).[333]
In November 2013, Google announced plans for a newLondonheadquarter, a notable 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[334]Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to theCamden Councilin June 2017. The new building, if approved, will feature a rooftop garden with a running track, giant moving blinds, a swimming pool, and a multi-use games area for sports.[335][336]
In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus inHyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[337][338]
Since  1998,[update]Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on theirhomepageintended to celebrateholidays, events, achievements and people. The first GoogleDoodlewas in honor of theBurning Man Festivalof 1998.[339][340]The doodle was designed byLarry PageandSergey Brinto notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-internDennis Hwangto design a logo forBastille Dayin 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".[341]
Google has a tradition of creatingApril Fools' Dayjokes. On April 1, 2000,Google MentalPlexallegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[342]In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service calledTiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of afiber-opticcable down their toilet.[343]Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement forGmail Paper, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.[344]In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.[345]
In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor ofTopeka, Kansas, whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its newGoogle Fiber Project.[346][347]In 2011, Google announcedGmail Motion, an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.[348]
Google's services containeaster eggs, such as theSwedish Chef's "Bork bork bork,"Pig Latin, "Hacker" orleetspeak,Elmer Fudd,Pirate, andKlingonas language selections for its search engine.[349]The search engine calculator provides theAnswer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and EverythingfromDouglas Adams'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[350]When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.[351]
When searching for the word "anagram," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"[352]In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "kayakacross thePacific Ocean." DuringFIFA World Cup 2010, search queries including "World Cup" and "FIFA" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.[353]
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropicGoogle.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[354]The mission of the organization is to create awareness aboutclimate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viableplug-in hybridelectric vehiclethat can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hiredLarry Brilliantas the program's executive director in 2004[355]and Megan Smith has since[update]replaced him has director.[356]
In 2008, Google announced its "project 10100" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[357]After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[358]Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[359]
In March 2007, in partnership with theMathematical Sciences Research Institute(MSRI), Google hosted the firstJulia Robinson Mathematics Festivalat its headquarters in Mountain View.[360]In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros toInternational Mathematical Olympiadto support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[361][362]In July 2012, Google launched a "Legalize Love" campaign in support ofgay rights.[363]
Google uses varioustax avoidance strategies. Out of thefive largest American technology companies, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits throughIrelandand theNetherlandsand then toBermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.[364]This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google'stransfer pricingpractices.[365]
Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.[366]
Google Vice-PresidentMatt Brittintestified to thePublic Accounts Committeeof the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[367]In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[368]
In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[369]
Since  2007,[update]Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[370]
Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[371]
In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE<C)" project.[372]However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".[373]
In June 2013,The Washington Postreported that Google had donated $50,000 to theCompetitive Enterprise Institute, alibertarianthink tankthat calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.[374]
In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma SenatorJim Inhofe, who has called climate change a "hoax".[375]In 2014 Google cut ties with theAmerican Legislative Exchange Council(ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.[376]
In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[377]
In 2013, Google ranked 5th inlobbyingspending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[378]
Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including theHigh-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigationwhich resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.[379]
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of€2.42 billion from theEuropean Unionfor "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."[380]Commenting on the penalty,New Scientistmagazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.[381]
On July 18, 2018,[382]theEuropean Commissionfined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[383]that it had appealed the fine to theGeneral Courtof the European Union.[384]
On January 21, 2019, French data regulatorCNILimposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was “deeply committed” to transparency and was “studying the decision” before determining its response.[385]
Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, includingcriticism of the companyover issues such asaggressive tax avoidance,[386]search neutrality,copyright,censorshipof search results and content,[387]andprivacy.[388][389]Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others'intellectual property, concerns that itscompilation of datamay violate people'sprivacy, and theenergy consumptionof its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such asmonopoly,restraint of trade,anti-competitive practices, andpatent infringement.
FormerDeputy Defense SecretaryRobert O. Workin 2018 criticizes Google and its employees have stepped into aMoral Hazardfor themselves as not continuing Pentagon'sartificial intelligenceproject while helping the autocratic communist China's AI technology that could be used against the United States in a conflict. He described Google as hypocritical, given it has opened an AI center in China and “Anything that’s going on in the AI center in China is going to the Chinese government and then will ultimately end up in the hands of the Chinese military." Work said. “I didn’t see any Google employee saying, ‘Hmm, maybe we shouldn’t do that.'” Google's dealings with China is decrying as unpatriotic.[390][391][392][393]
Google adhered to theInternet censorship policies of China,[394]enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "TheGreat Firewall of China".The Interceptreported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the people's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known asDragonfly) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".[395][396]
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffGeneralJoseph Dunfordalso criticizes Google as "it’s inexplicable" that it continue investing in autocraticcommunist China, who usescensorship technology to restrain freedomsandcrackdown peoplethere and has long history ofintellectual propertyandpatenttheft which hurts U.S. companies, while simultaneously not renewing further research and development collaborations withthe Pentagon. He said “I’m not sure that people at Google will enjoy a world order that is informed by the norms and standards of Russia or China.” He urges Google work directly with the U.S. government instead of making controversial inroads into China. SenatorMark Warner(D-VA) criticized Dragonfly evidences China's success at "recruit[ing] Western companies to their information control efforts" while China exports cyber and censorship infrastructure toauthoritarianregimes like Venezuela, Ethiopia, and Pakistan.[397][398][399]
Google'smission statement, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",[400]and its unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil".[401]In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".[402]The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.[11]
Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviors which appear to contradict this.[403][404]
Following media reports aboutPRISM, NSA's massive electronicsurveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[405]According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.[406]
On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributeda memothroughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[407]Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace", and he was fired on the same day.[408][409][410]New York TimescolumnistDavid Brooksargued Pichai had mishandled the case, and called for his resignation.[411][412]
Reportedly, Google's influencedNew Americathink tank to expel their Open Markets research group, after the group has criticized Google monopolistic power and supported theEU $2.7B fine of Google.[413][414]
Google has worked with theUnited States Department of Defenseon drone software through the 2017 "Project Maven" that could be used to improve the accuracy ofdrone strikes.[415]Thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEOSundar Pichaito end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.[416]In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not renew their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.[417]
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before theNinth Circuit of the United States Court of Appealsthat "google" had sufferedgenericide. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with theNational Arbitration Forum(NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."[418]
On 10 December 2018, a New Zealand court ordered that the name of a man accused of murdering British travellerGrace Millanebe withheld from the public. The next morning, Google named the man in an email it sent people who had subscribed to "what's trending in New Zealand".[419]Lawyers warned that this could compromise the trial, and Justice Minister Andrew Little said that Google was in contempt of court.[420][421]Google said that it had been unaware of the court order, and that the email had been created by algorithms.
On 21 January 2019, Google was fined €50 million (US$57 million) for violating theGDPR.[422]It is the biggest fine issued byCNILfor violation of the regulation.[423]

Google LLC[5]is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which includeonline advertising technologies,search engine,cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of theBig Fourtechnology companies, alongsideAmazon,AppleandFacebook.[6][7]
Google was founded in 1998 byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhile they were Ph.D. students atStanford UniversityinCalifornia. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power throughsupervotingstock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed theGoogleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate calledAlphabet Inc.Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests.Sundar Pichaiwas appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.
The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs,Google Sheets, andGoogle Slides), email (Gmail/Inbox), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage (Google Drive), social networking (Google+), instant messaging and video chat (Google Allo,Duo,Hangouts), language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps,Waze,Google Earth,Street View), video sharing (YouTube), note-taking (Google Keep), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of theAndroidmobile operating system, theGoogle Chromeweb browser, andChrome OS, a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of itsNexusdevices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including theGoogle Pixelsmartphone,Google Homesmart speaker,Google Wifimesh wireless router, andGoogle Daydreamvirtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber,Project Fi, andGoogle Station).[8]
Google.com is the most visited website in the world.[9]Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, includingYouTubeandBlogger. Google is the most valuable brand in the world as of  2017,[update][10]but has received significantcriticisminvolving issues such asprivacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust,censorship, and search neutrality. Google'smission statementis "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil" until the phrase was removed from the company's code of conduct around May 2018.[11][12]
Google began in January 1996 as a research project byLarry PageandSergey Brinwhen they were both PhD students atStanford UniversityinStanford, California.[14]
While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[15]They called this new technologyPageRank; it determined a website'srelevanceby the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[16][17]
Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.[18][19][20]Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word "googol",[21][22]the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[23]Originally, Google ran under Stanford University's website, with the domainsgoogle.stanford.edu[24]andz.stanford.edu.[25]
The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,[26]and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[14]) inMenlo Park, California.Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[14][27][28]
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 fromAndy Bechtolsheim, co-founder ofSun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.[30]Google received money from three otherangel investorsin 1998:Amazon.comfounderJeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professorDavid Cheriton, and entrepreneurRam Shriram.[31]
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[31]a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[32]with major investors including theventure capitalfirmsKleiner PerkinsandSequoia Capital.[30]
Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google toExcite. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, talked the duo down to $750,000, but Bell still rejected it.[33]
Google'sinitial public offering(IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, andEric Schmidtagreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[34]
At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[35][36]Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built byMorgan StanleyandCredit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[37][38]The sale of $1.67 bn (billion) gave Google amarket capitalizationof more than $23bn.[39]By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn.[40]The vast majority of the 271 million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires.Yahoo!, a competitor of Google, also benefitted because it owned 8.4 million shares of Google before the IPO took place.[41]
There were concerns that Google's IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires.[42]As a reply to this concern, co-founders Brin and Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company's culture.[43]In 2005, articles inThe New York Times[44]and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[45][46][47]In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment.[48]Google has also faced allegations ofsexismandageismfrom former employees.[49][50]In 2013, aclass action againstseveralSilicon Valleycompanies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[51]
The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[52]primarily because of strong sales and earnings in theonline advertisingmarket.[53]The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors andmutual funds.[53]GOOG shares split into GOOGclass C sharesand GOOGLclass A shares.[54]The company is listed on theNASDAQstock exchange under theticker symbolsGOOGL and GOOG, and on theFrankfurt Stock Exchangeunder the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.[update][55]
In March 1999, the company moved its offices toPalo Alto, California,[56]which is home to several prominentSilicon Valleytechnology start-ups.[57]The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.[58][14]To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[59]
This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered byGoto.com, anIdealabspin-off created byBill Gross.[60][61]When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamedYahoo! Search Marketing. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.[62]
In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider forYahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacingInktomi.[63][64]
In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism.[65]The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex fromSilicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway inMountain View, California.[66]The complex became known as theGoogleplex, a play on the wordgoogolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. TheGoogleplexinteriors were designed byClive WilkinsonArchitects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.[67]By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be added to theMerriam-WebsterCollegiate Dictionaryand theOxford English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".[68][69]The first use of "Google" as a verb inpop culturehappened on the TV seriesBuffy the Vampire Slayer, in 2002.[70]
In 2005,The Washington Postreported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.[71]In January 2008, all the data that passed through Google's MapReduce software component had an aggregated size of 20petabytesper day.[72][73][74]In 2009, aCNNreport about top political searches of 2009 noted that "more than a billion searches" are being typed into Google on a daily basis.[75]In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million).[76]
The year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[77]
In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[78]
Google announced the launch of a new company, calledCalico, on September 19, 2013, to be led byApple, Inc.chairmanArthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".[79]
Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, and in 2016 it celebrated its 18th birthday with an animated version of its logo (a "Google Doodle"),[80]although it has used other dates for its official birthday.[81]The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engineYahoo! Searchin 2005 has been suggested as the cause.[82][83]
TheAlliance for Affordable Internet(A4AI) was launched in October 2013; Google is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includesFacebook,Intel, andMicrosoft. Led bySir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[84]
The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[85]Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements.[86]
According toInterbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behindApple Inc.) in 2013,[87]2014,[88]2015,[89]and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.[90]
In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85TBof data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."[91][92]
As of  October 2016,[update]Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries.[93]Alexa, a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.[9]Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including YouTube[94]and Blogger.[95]
In 2001, Google acquiredDeja News, the operators of a large archive of materials fromUsenet.[96][97]Google rebranded the archive asGoogle Groups, and by the end of the year, it had expanded the history back to 1981.[98][99]

In 2004, Google acquiredKeyhole, Inc.[103]Keyhole'seponymousproduct was later renamedGoogle Earth.
In April 2005, Google acquiredUrchin Software, using their Urchin on Demand product (along with ideas from Adaptive Path's Measure Map) to createGoogle Analyticsin 2006.
In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock,[104][105]and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[106][107]
On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquireDoubleClickfor $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.[108]The deal was approved despite anti-trust concerns raised by competitorsMicrosoftandAT&T.[109]
In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the firm has partnered with other organizations for research, advertising, and other activities. In 2005, Google partnered withNASAAmes Research Centerto build 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of offices.[110]
In 2005 Google partnered withAOL[111]to enhance each other'svideo searchservices. In 2006 Google andFox Interactive MediaofNews Corporationentered into a $900 million agreement to provide search and advertising on the then-popular social networking siteMySpace.[112]
In 2007, Google began sponsoringNORAD Tracks Santa, displacing the former sponsor AOL. NORAD Tracks Santa purports to followSanta Claus' progress onChristmas Eve,[113]using Google Earth to "track Santa" in 3-D for the first time.[114][115]
In 2008, Google developed a partnership withGeoEyeto launch a satellite providing Google with high-resolution (0.41 m monochrome, 1.65 m color) imagery for Google Earth. The satellite was launched fromVandenberg Air Force Baseon September 6, 2008.[116]Google also announced in 2008 that it was hosting an archive ofLife Magazine's photographs.[117][118]
In 2010,Google Energymade its first investment in arenewable energyproject, putting $38.8 million into twowind farmsinNorth Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed byNextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.[119]In February 2010, theFederal Energy Regulatory CommissionFERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[120]The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities.[121]The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[122]
Also in 2010, Google purchasedGlobal IP Solutions, a Norway-based company that provides web-basedteleconferencingand other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products.[123]On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad networkAdMob. This occurred days after theFederal Trade Commissionclosed its investigation into the purchase.[124]Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount.[125]In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.[126]
On April 4, 2011,The Globe and Mailreported that Google bid $900 million for 6000Nortel Networkspatents.[127]
On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquireMotorola Mobilityfor $12.5 billion[128][129]subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.[130]The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval ofChina.[131]
This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[132]mainlyAppleandMicrosoft,[130]and to allow it to continue to freely offerAndroid.[133]After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google's strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to lay off 4000 Motorola Mobility employees.[134]On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility toFlextronicsfor $75 million.[135]As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices.[136]On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility toArris Groupfor $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. As a part of this deal, Google acquired a 15.7% stake in Arris Group valued at $300 million.[137][138]
In June 2013, Google acquiredWaze, a $966 million deal.[139]While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze andGoogle Maps, Google's own mapping service.[140]
On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquireDeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company fromLondon. DeepMind describes itself as having the ability to combine the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build general-purpose learning algorithms. DeepMind's first commercial applications were used in simulations, e-commerce and games. As of  December 2013,[update]it was reported that DeepMind had roughly 75 employees.[141]Technology news websiteRecodereported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price.[142][143]The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.[144]
On January 29, 2014, Google announced that it would divest Motorola Mobility toLenovofor $2.91 billion, a fraction of the original $12.5 billion price paid by Google to acquire the company. Google retained all but 2000 of Motorola's patents and entered into cross-licensing deals.[145]
On September 21, 2017,HTCannounced a "cooperation agreement" in which it would sell non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, as well as smartphone talent, to Google for $1.1 billion.[146][147][148]
On December 6, 2017, Google made its first investment inIndiaand picked up a significant minority stake in hyper-local concierge and delivery player Dunzo.[149]The Benguluru-based startup received $12 million investment in Google's series B funding round.[150]
On March 29, 2018, Google led a Series C funding round into online-to-offline fashion e-commerce start-up Fynd.[151]It was its second direct investment in India with an undisclosed amount.[152][153]In this way, Google is also looking to build an ecosystem in India across high-frequency hyper-local transactions as well as in the healthcare, financial services, and education sectors.
On August 23, 2018, Google deleted 39YouTubeaccounts, 13Google+accounts and 6 blogs onBloggerdue to their engagement in politically motivated phishing, the deleted accounts were found to be tied withIslamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).[154][155][156]
Google data centersare located in North and South America, Asia, Europe.[157]
Traditionally, Google relied onparallel computingon commodity hardware[158]like mainstream x86 computers similar to home PCs[159]to keep costs per query low.[160]In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[160]
In October 2013,The Washington Postreported that the U.S.National Security Agencyintercepted communications between Google's data centers, as part of a program namedMUSCULAR.[161][162]This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network.[163]Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013.[164]
Google's most efficient data center runs at 35 °C (95 °F) using only fresh air cooling, requiring no electrically powered air conditioning; the servers run so hot that humans cannot go near them for extended periods.[165]
An August 2011 report estimated that Google had about 900,000 servers in their data centers, based on energy usage. The report does state that "Google never says how many servers are running in its data centers."[166]
In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".[167][168][169]
On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as aconglomeratecalledAlphabet. Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure,Sundar Pichaibecame CEO of Google, replacingLarry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[170][171][172]
On September 1, 2017, Google Inc. announced its plans of restructuring as alimited liability company, Google LLC, as a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings Inc., which is formed as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. to hold the equity of its other subsidiaries, including Google LLC and other bets.[173]
As per its 2017 Annual report, Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on google and YouTube, android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. 46% of this was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namelyAdMob,AdSense(such as AdSense for Content,AdSensefor Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[174]
For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492billion in total advertising revenues and only $112million in licensing and other revenues.[175]In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.[176]In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the companyDoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.[177][178]
In 2007, Google launched "AdSense for Mobile", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.[179]
Google Analyticsallows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[180]Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google'sAdWordsallows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[181]The sister service, GoogleAdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.[182]
One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility ofclick fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20  percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[183]
In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements ofOceana, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."[184]In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because ofantitrustconcerns by theU.S. Department of Justice. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.[185][186]
In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.[187]
According tocomScoremarket research from November 2009,Google Searchis the dominant search engine in the United States market, with amarket shareof 65.6%.[188]Googleindexesbillions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords andoperators.[189]
In 2003,The New York Timescomplained about Google'sindexing, claiming that Google'scachingof content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.[190]In bothField v. GoogleandParker v. Google, the United States District Court ofNevadaruled in favor of Google.[191][192]The publication2600: The Hacker Quarterlyhas compiled a list of words that google's newinstant search featurewill not search.[193]
Google also hostsGoogle Books. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. TheAuthors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.[194]Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.[195]Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière (Éditions du Seuil) from its database.[196]In competition withAmazon.com, Google sells digital versions of new books.[197]
On July 21, 2010, in response toBing, Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence ofthumbnailsthat enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.[198]
The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.[199]
In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusiveinterstitial advertisementswhen a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.[200]
In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages fromGmailand photos fromGoogle Photos.[201][202]
G Suiteis a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, includingGmail,Google DriveandGoogle Docs,Google SheetsandGoogle Slides, with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support.[203]
Google Search Appliancewas launched in February 2002, targeted toward providing search technology for larger organizations.[14]Google launched theMinithree years later, which was targeted at smaller organizations. Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.[204]Site Search customers were notified by email in late March 2017 that no new licenses for Site Search would be sold after April 1, 2017, but that customer and technical support would be provided for the duration of existing license agreements.[205][206]
On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, "a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers" which can be integrated withBigQueryon the Google Cloud Platform.

Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games,table football, a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the recreation room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition.[307]Free food is available to employees 24/7, with the offerings provided by paid vending machinesproratedbased on and favoring those of better nutritional value.[308]
Google's extensive amenities are not available to all of its workers. Temporary workers such as book scanners do not have access to shuttles, Google cafes, or other perks.[309]
In 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space in New York City, at111 Eighth Avenuein Manhattan. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team, which has been instrumental in securing large partnerships.[310]The New York headquarters includes a game room, micro-kitchens, and a video game area.[311]In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion, the biggest for a single building in the United States that year.[312][313]In February 2012, Google moved additional employees to the New York City campus, with a total of around 2,750 employees.[314]
Google's New York City location continued to expand in 2018. In March of that year, Google's parent company Alphabet boughtChelsea Marketbuilding for $2.4 billion nearby its current New York HQ. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[315][316][317][318]The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan'sHudson Squareneighborhood.[319][320]Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[321]
By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division inAnn Arbor, Michigan.[322]In November 2006, Google opened offices onCarnegie Mellon's campus inPittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding andsmartphone applicationsand programs.[323][324]Other office locations in the U.S. includeAtlanta, Georgia;Austin, Texas;Boulder, Colorado;Cambridge, Massachusetts;San Francisco,California;Seattle, Washington;Kirkland, Washington;Birmingham, Michigan;Reston, Virginia, andWashington, D.C.[325]
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands ofsolar panelsto provide up to 1.6 megawattsof electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[326]The system will be the largestsolar power systemconstructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[326]In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds ofgoatsto keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing thecarbon footprintof mowing the extensive grounds.[327][328]The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated fromBob Widlar, an engineer who worked forNational Semiconductor.[329]In 2008, Google faced accusations inHarper's Magazineof being an "energy glutton". The company was accused of employing its "Don't be evil" motto and its publicenergy-savingcampaigns to cover up or make up for the massive amounts of energy its servers require.[330]
Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[331]It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namelySydney(birthplace location ofGoogle Maps)[332]andLondon(part ofAndroiddevelopment).[333]
In November 2013, Google announced plans for a newLondonheadquarter, a notable 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[334]Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to theCamden Councilin June 2017. The new building, if approved, will feature a rooftop garden with a running track, giant moving blinds, a swimming pool, and a multi-use games area for sports.[335][336]
In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus inHyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[337][338]
Since  1998,[update]Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on theirhomepageintended to celebrateholidays, events, achievements and people. The first GoogleDoodlewas in honor of theBurning Man Festivalof 1998.[339][340]The doodle was designed byLarry PageandSergey Brinto notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-internDennis Hwangto design a logo forBastille Dayin 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".[341]
Google has a tradition of creatingApril Fools' Dayjokes. On April 1, 2000,Google MentalPlexallegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[342]In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service calledTiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of afiber-opticcable down their toilet.[343]Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement forGmail Paper, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.[344]In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.[345]
In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor ofTopeka, Kansas, whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its newGoogle Fiber Project.[346][347]In 2011, Google announcedGmail Motion, an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.[348]
Google's services containeaster eggs, such as theSwedish Chef's "Bork bork bork,"Pig Latin, "Hacker" orleetspeak,Elmer Fudd,Pirate, andKlingonas language selections for its search engine.[349]The search engine calculator provides theAnswer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and EverythingfromDouglas Adams'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[350]When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.[351]
When searching for the word "anagram," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"[352]In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "kayakacross thePacific Ocean." DuringFIFA World Cup 2010, search queries including "World Cup" and "FIFA" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.[353]
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropicGoogle.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion.[354]The mission of the organization is to create awareness aboutclimate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viableplug-in hybridelectric vehiclethat can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hiredLarry Brilliantas the program's executive director in 2004[355]and Megan Smith has since[update]replaced him has director.[356]
In 2008, Google announced its "project 10100" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[357]After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,[358]Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[359]
In March 2007, in partnership with theMathematical Sciences Research Institute(MSRI), Google hosted the firstJulia Robinson Mathematics Festivalat its headquarters in Mountain View.[360]In 2011, Google donated 1 million euros toInternational Mathematical Olympiadto support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[361][362]In July 2012, Google launched a "Legalize Love" campaign in support ofgay rights.[363]
Google uses varioustax avoidance strategies. Out of thefive largest American technology companies, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits throughIrelandand theNetherlandsand then toBermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.[364]This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google'stransfer pricingpractices.[365]
Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.[366]
Google Vice-PresidentMatt Brittintestified to thePublic Accounts Committeeof the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[367]In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.[368]
In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.[369]
Since  2007,[update]Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.[370]
Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[371]
In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE<C)" project.[372]However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".[373]
In June 2013,The Washington Postreported that Google had donated $50,000 to theCompetitive Enterprise Institute, alibertarianthink tankthat calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.[374]
In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma SenatorJim Inhofe, who has called climate change a "hoax".[375]In 2014 Google cut ties with theAmerican Legislative Exchange Council(ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.[376]
In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.[377]
In 2013, Google ranked 5th inlobbyingspending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[378]
Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including theHigh-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigationwhich resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.[379]
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of€2.42 billion from theEuropean Unionfor "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."[380]Commenting on the penalty,New Scientistmagazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.[381]
On July 18, 2018,[382]theEuropean Commissionfined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[383]that it had appealed the fine to theGeneral Courtof the European Union.[384]
On January 21, 2019, French data regulatorCNILimposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was “deeply committed” to transparency and was “studying the decision” before determining its response.[385]
Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, includingcriticism of the companyover issues such asaggressive tax avoidance,[386]search neutrality,copyright,censorshipof search results and content,[387]andprivacy.[388][389]Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others'intellectual property, concerns that itscompilation of datamay violate people'sprivacy, and theenergy consumptionof its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such asmonopoly,restraint of trade,anti-competitive practices, andpatent infringement.
FormerDeputy Defense SecretaryRobert O. Workin 2018 criticizes Google and its employees have stepped into aMoral Hazardfor themselves as not continuing Pentagon'sartificial intelligenceproject while helping the autocratic communist China's AI technology that could be used against the United States in a conflict. He described Google as hypocritical, given it has opened an AI center in China and “Anything that’s going on in the AI center in China is going to the Chinese government and then will ultimately end up in the hands of the Chinese military." Work said. “I didn’t see any Google employee saying, ‘Hmm, maybe we shouldn’t do that.'” Google's dealings with China is decrying as unpatriotic.[390][391][392][393]
Google adhered to theInternet censorship policies of China,[394]enforced by means of filters colloquially known as "TheGreat Firewall of China".The Interceptreported in August 2018 that Google is developing for the people's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known asDragonfly) "that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".[395][396]
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffGeneralJoseph Dunfordalso criticizes Google as "it’s inexplicable" that it continue investing in autocraticcommunist China, who usescensorship technology to restrain freedomsandcrackdown peoplethere and has long history ofintellectual propertyandpatenttheft which hurts U.S. companies, while simultaneously not renewing further research and development collaborations withthe Pentagon. He said “I’m not sure that people at Google will enjoy a world order that is informed by the norms and standards of Russia or China.” He urges Google work directly with the U.S. government instead of making controversial inroads into China. SenatorMark Warner(D-VA) criticized Dragonfly evidences China's success at "recruit[ing] Western companies to their information control efforts" while China exports cyber and censorship infrastructure toauthoritarianregimes like Venezuela, Ethiopia, and Pakistan.[397][398][399]
Google'smission statement, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful",[400]and its unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil".[401]In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".[402]The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.[11]
Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviors which appear to contradict this.[403][404]
Following media reports aboutPRISM, NSA's massive electronicsurveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[405]According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.[406]
On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributeda memothroughout the company which argued that "Google's ideological echo chamber" and bias clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions.[407]Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore in violating company policy by "advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace", and he was fired on the same day.[408][409][410]New York TimescolumnistDavid Brooksargued Pichai had mishandled the case, and called for his resignation.[411][412]
Reportedly, Google's influencedNew Americathink tank to expel their Open Markets research group, after the group has criticized Google monopolistic power and supported theEU $2.7B fine of Google.[413][414]
Google has worked with theUnited States Department of Defenseon drone software through the 2017 "Project Maven" that could be used to improve the accuracy ofdrone strikes.[415]Thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEOSundar Pichaito end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.[416]In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not renew their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.[417]
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before theNinth Circuit of the United States Court of Appealsthat "google" had sufferedgenericide. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with theNational Arbitration Forum(NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."[418]
On 10 December 2018, a New Zealand court ordered that the name of a man accused of murdering British travellerGrace Millanebe withheld from the public. The next morning, Google named the man in an email it sent people who had subscribed to "what's trending in New Zealand".[419]Lawyers warned that this could compromise the trial, and Justice Minister Andrew Little said that Google was in contempt of court.[420][421]Google said that it had been unaware of the court order, and that the email had been created by algorithms.
On 21 January 2019, Google was fined €50 million (US$57 million) for violating theGDPR.[422]It is the biggest fine issued byCNILfor violation of the regulation.[423]
